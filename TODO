Big todos:
Tall call optimisation
Avoid using the C stack, replace function call with a goto to the head of the function

Memory management:
Using tracing.

Call/cc: 
all variables have to be stored in the heap, not in the stack, or my own implementation of a stack.

Debugging help
Keep an auxilary stack trace with the original names+line numbers of the scheme functions
